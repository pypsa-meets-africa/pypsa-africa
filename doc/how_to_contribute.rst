Ð¡ontribute
##########################################

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
Every little bit helps, and you always earn credits.

You can contribute on the code side in many ways:

* submit feedback,
* add new features,
* report bugs,
* fix bugs,
* implement a new cluster/cloud computation backend,
* write documentation


Code
====

Linting and pre-commit
----------------------
For every code contribution you should run `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/index.html>`_.
This will lint, format and check your code contributions against our guidelines
(e.g. we use `Black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ as code style
and aim for `REUSE compliance <https://reuse.software/>`_):

1. Installation ``conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit`` or ``pip install pre-commit``
2. Usage:
  * To automatically activate ``pre-commit`` on every ``git commit``: Run ``pre-commit install``
  * To manually run it: ``pre-commit run --all``

Testing
-------
Add a new test if you want to contribute new functionality to the config.
We perform currently *multiple* integration tests which means various workflows need to work.
All test configs are build by updating the ``config.tutorial.yaml`` with the configs in ``pypysa-earth/test/*.yaml``.

  * You can test your contribution locally with ``snakemake --cores 4 run_tests``. This will build test configs and executes them.
  * Run ``snakemake -j1 build_test_configs`` to build and analyse locally the test configs.

To contribute a test:

1. Provide a new test in ``test/<new test>.yaml``, or adjust one of the existing ones. These tests update the config.tutorial.yaml to test other options e.g. landlock countries.
2. Add a new test config path to the ``rule build_all_test`` in the ``Snakefile``.
3. If your functionality should be tested in the CI for every pull request, add a respective code in ``.github/workflows/ci-linux.yaml``. We test all functionalities only for Linux while providing a general test for windows and mac.

Performance-profiling
---------------------
Performance profiling is important to understand bottlenecks and
the accordingly optimize the speed in PyPSA-Earth. We use the Python built-in
`cProfiler`, custom decorators on single functions and analysis tools
like `snakeviz <https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/>`_. See a detailed example
in `this discussion #557 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/discussions/557>`_.


No-Code
========
Instead of contributing code there are alternatives to support the PyPSA-Earth goals.
You can fund projects, supervise people, support us with outreach activities or events.
Check out our `website <https://pypsa-meets-earth.github.io>`_ for more details.
