*Motivation*. Closed-source models are the current standard for most policy and industry decisions. However, open models have proven to be
competitive alternatives that promote science, robust technical analysis, collaboration and transparent policy decision making.
Yet, two issues slow the adoption: open models are often designed with limited geographic scope, hindering synergies to collaborate,
or are based on low spatially resolved data, limiting their utility.

*PyPSA-Earth* is the first open-source global energy system model with data in high spatial and temporal resolution. It enables
large-scale collaboration by providing a tool that can model the world energy system or any subset of it. This work is derived
from the European PyPSA-Eur model using new data and functions. It is suitable for operational as well as combined generation,
storage and transmission expansion studies. We work hard to extend the PyPSA-Earth model by end of this year to include sector-coupling,
myopic and perfect pathway expansion capabilities.

*PyPSA meets Earth initiative* members are maintaining the *PyPSA-Earth* repository as well as many other tools.
The `website <https://pypsa-meets-earth.github.io/>`_ provides more context of the initiative and the associated projects.
